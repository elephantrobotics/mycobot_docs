## What is Python?

**Our products are very friendly to Python, and the development of Python API library is also improving day by day. Through Python, the robot's joint angles, coordinates, grippers and other aspects can be controlled. There are many options. If you want to control our robot arm through Python programming, you can learn this chapter.**

## ![README1](../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/python/python.jpg)

**Python** was designed by Guido van Rossum of the Netherlands Institute for Mathematical and Computer Science Research in the early 1990s as a replacement for a language called ABC.

**Python** provides efficient high-level data structures and simple and effective object-oriented programming.

**Python** syntax and dynamic typing, as well as the nature of interpreted languages, make it a programming language for writing scripts and rapidly developing applications on most platforms. With the continuous update of versions and the addition of new language functions, it is gradually used for the development of independent and large projects.

**Python** interpreter is easy to extend, and can be extended with new functions and data types using C or C++ (or other languages ​​that can be called from C).

**Python** can also be used as an extension language in customizable software. **Python** has a rich standard library that provides source code or machine code for all major system platforms.
