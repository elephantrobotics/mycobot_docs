# C++

**Using C++ language, you can freely develop (coordinate control, angle control, io control, gripper control, etc.) through the C++ dynamic library developed by our company, and control some robots that our company has developed. **<br>

## What is C++?

C++ is the inheritance of C language. It can perform procedural programming of C language, object-based programming with abstract data types as its characteristics, and object-oriented programming with inheritance and polymorphism as its characteristics. <br>
C++ is good at object-oriented programming, and it can also perform procedural programming. Therefore, C++ can adapt to the scale of problems. <br>
C++ not only has the practical characteristics of efficient computer operation, but also is committed to improving the programming quality of large-scale programs and the problem description ability of programming languages.

**Applicable devices:**
