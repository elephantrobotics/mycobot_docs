## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as part of a web page, and its implementation allows client-side scripts to interact with users and generate dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. <br>

JavaScript is a very famous programming language that was originally started twenty years ago with the motivation of making web pages lively. It is also an important part of the skillset of web developers. <br>
The JavaScript scripting language does not depend on the operating system and only requires browser support. Therefore, a JavaScript script can be brought to any machine after it is written, provided that the browser on the machine supports the JavaScript scripting language, which is supported by most browsers. <br>

JavaScript is easy to learn but difficult to master and is used for a variety of purposes, from simply enhancing website functionality to running cool games and web-based software. <br>
