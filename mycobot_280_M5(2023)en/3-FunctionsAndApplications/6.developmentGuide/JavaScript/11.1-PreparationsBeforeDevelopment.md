#### 3 Linux node environment setup
The first step is that the Node official website has changed the Linux download version to a compiled version. We can directly download and decompress it for use:
```
# wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.9.0/node-v10.9.0-linux-x64.tar.xz // Download
# tar xf node-v10.9.0-linux-x64.tar.xz // Decompress
# cd node-v10.9.0-linux-x64/ // Enter the decompression directory
# ./bin/node -v // Execute the node command to view the version
v10.9.0
```
The second step is to decompress the bin of the file The directory contains commands such as node and npm. We can use the ln command to set up soft links:
```
ln -s /usr/software/nodejs/bin/npm /usr/local/bin/
ln -s /usr/software/nodejs/bin/node /usr/local/bin/
```
#### 4 Install Node.js from source code in Ubuntu
> Step 1 In the following section, we will introduce how to install Node.js from source code in Ubuntu Linux. Other Linux systems, such as Centos, have similar installation steps as follows. Get the Node.js source code from Github:
```
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/nodejs/node.git
Cloning into 'node'...
```
Step 2 Modify directory permissions
```
$ sudo chmod -R 755 node
```
Step 3 Use ./configure to create a compilation file and enter the instructions in the following order:
```
$ cd node
$ sudo ./configure
$ sudo make
$ sudo make install
```
Step 4 Check the node version:
```
$ node --version
v0.10.25
```
