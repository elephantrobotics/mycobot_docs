## What is myBlockly?

![](../../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/myBlocklyAndUlFlow/myblocklyTutorials/myblockly界面.jpg)

**myBlockly** is a fully visual modular programming software, a graphical programming language.

**myBlockly** is similar to MIT's children's programming language Scratch in terms of function/design.

When using **myBlockly**, users can drag and drop modules to build code logic, which is very similar to building blocks.

From the user's perspective, **myBlockly** is a simple and easy-to-use visual tool for generating code. From the developer's perspective, **myBlockly** is a text box that contains the code entered by the user.

The process of generating code into the text box is the process of the user dragging in **myBlockly**.
