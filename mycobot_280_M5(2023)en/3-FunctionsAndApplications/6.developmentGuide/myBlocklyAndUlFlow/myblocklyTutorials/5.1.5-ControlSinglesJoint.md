* Scope of application: This module is applicable to the 4-axis myPalletizer series

* Parameter introduction:

This module has two parameters that can be adjusted:

* Joint angle parameters: You can set the parameters within the range of joint motion of the robot arm as needed (for details of the joint motion range, please refer to **2. Product Introduction**)

* Speed ​​parameters: You can set the parameters within the range of robot arm motion speed as needed (for the maximum motion speed, please refer to **2. Product Introduction**)

* Purpose: Control the motion of multiple joints of the robot arm

#### Simple demonstration

* The graphic code is as follows:

* Implementation content:

Control all joints of the robot to return to the origin. After two seconds,

Control joints 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the robot to run at a speed of 50 to 30 degrees, 30 degrees, -30 degrees and 50 degrees respectively. After two seconds,

Control all joints of the robot to return to the origin at a speed of 50. After two seconds,

Control joints 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the robot to run at a speed of 50 to -30 degrees, 0 degrees, 30 degrees and -50 degrees respectively. After two seconds, end the program.
