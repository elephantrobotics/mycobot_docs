* Scope of application: This module is suitable for 4-axis myPalletizer series

* Parameter introduction:

This module has two parameters that can be adjusted:

* Joint angle parameters: You can set the parameters within the range of joint motion of the robot arm as needed (for details of the joint motion range, please refer to Product Introduction chapter

* Speed ​​parameters: You can set the parameters within the range of robot arm motion speed as needed (for the maximum motion speed, please refer to **Product Introduction**)

* Purpose: Control the motion of multiple joints of the robot arm

#### Simple demonstration

* The graphic code is as follows:

* Implementation content:

Control all joints of the robot arm to return to their original positions, and the RGB light board turns red.

After one second, control joints 1, 2, and 3 to run at a speed of 50 to 30 degrees, 50 degrees, and -10 degrees respectively.

After one second, the RGB light board turns green.

After one second, control joints 1, 2, and 3 to run at a speed of 50 to -30 degrees, 30 degrees, and -30 degrees respectively.

After one second, the RGB light board turns blue.

After one second, control all the robot arms to shut down and return to their original positions.
