- Set the gripper state: open, closed, released. Pay attention to the movement of the gripper.

- Click the Read Angle button to get the current gripper value.

- You can fine-tune the gripper value.

- You can set the gripper's moving speed.

> Tips: When the gripper type is Dexterous Hand, you cannot set the gripper value, you can only set its status.
