* Implementation content:

Power on the robot arm and control the robot arm to move back to the origin. After two seconds,

Control the robot arm 1 joint to run to the angle 50 position at a speed of 20. After two seconds,

Control the robot arm 2 joint to run to the angle 20 position at a speed of 20. After two seconds,

Control the robot arm 2 joint again to run to the angle -50 position at a speed of 20. After two seconds,

Loop the control of the 2 joints twice. After the loop ends,

Run the 1st joint, 2nd joint, 3rd joint and 4th joint at a speed of 20 to the angles of 130, 80, -60 and 100 respectively.

Finally, the robot arm movement is paused, all joints are released, and the program ends.
