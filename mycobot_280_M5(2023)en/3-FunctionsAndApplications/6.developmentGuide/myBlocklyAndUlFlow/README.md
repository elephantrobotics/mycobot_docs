## What is drag-and-drop programming?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drag-and-drop" programming is a basic technique that allows you to drag code building blocks or other visual cues instead of manually writing text-based code. In this way, complex and abstract programming languages ​​become easy to understand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hadi Partovi, founder of Code.org, once said: "Drag and drop programming allows you to easily understand the basics of programming without having to study character layout in detail. Once you learn the basic concept of using drag and drop, you will immediately want to learn how to use it to do practical things." This is very consistent with the basic logic of programming learning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many programs that can help you get started with drag and drop programming, including Google Blocky, Microsoft MakeCode, and MIT Scratch.

## What are myBlockly and UIFlow?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both myBlockly and UIFlow embody the idea of ​​drag-and-drop programming. The former was developed by the R&D team of Shenzhen Elephant Robotics, and the latter is a graphical programming platform developed by M5Stack.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them, myBlockly [▶](5.1-myblockly/README.md) is a puzzle-style programming software based on the python environment and the pymycobot dependency library, which allows users to program and control mycobot in a building block-style manner. It is especially suitable for beginners to learn programming and exercise programming thinking. myblockly also provides a python display interface, which converts the myblockly program built by the user into a python language program to help users learn python statements.
