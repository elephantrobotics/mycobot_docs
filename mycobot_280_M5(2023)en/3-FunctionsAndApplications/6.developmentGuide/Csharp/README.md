# **C#**
**Using c# language, you can freely develop (coordinate control, angle control, io control, gripper control, etc.) through the c# dynamic library provided by our company, and control some robots that our company has developed. **<br>
Supported robot models: **myCobot280, 320 and myPalletizer 260**. <br>

## What is C#?

C# is an object-oriented programming language derived from C and C++ released by Microsoft, and a high-level programming language that runs on .NET Framework and .NET Core (completely open source, cross-platform). <br>
C# is significantly different from Java. It borrows a feature from Delphi and is directly integrated with COM (Component Object Model), and it is the protagonist of Microsoft's .NET windows network framework. <br>
C# allows C++ programmers to develop programs efficiently, and because it can call native functions written in C/C++, it will never lose the original powerful functions of C/C++. Because of this inheritance relationship, C# and C/C++ have great similarities, and developers familiar with similar languages ​​can quickly switch to C#.<br>

**Applicable devices:**

- myCobot 280
- myCobot 280 M5
- myCobot 280 for Arduino <br>

- myCobot 320
- myCobot 320 M5 <br>

**Prerequisites:**

- **M5** series version, **M5Stack-basic** burn **miniRobot** at the bottom, select **Transponder** function, **ATOM** burn the latest version of **atomMain** at the end (factory default is burned)

## Programming development
