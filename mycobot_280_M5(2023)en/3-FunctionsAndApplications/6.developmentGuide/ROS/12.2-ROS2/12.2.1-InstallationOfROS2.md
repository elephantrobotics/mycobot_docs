# Environment Installation

# M5 Version:

**Note:**When installing the virtual machine system, please install the **Ubuntu 20.04 version of the system**. The installation method is the same as Ubuntu 18.04. If you want to use the moveIt2 function, you need to install **Ubuntu 22.04 version system**.

To install different versions of Ubuntu systems in Linux, please refer to the Environment Construction section.

##  1 ROS2 Environment Construction

### ROS2 Installation

The basic development environment construction requires the installation of the robot operating system ROS2 and the git version manager. The following describes their installation methods and processes respectively.

For **myCobot 280-M5**, **myCobot 320-M5**, **myPalletizer 260-M5** and **mechArm 270-M5** devices, please refer to the following installation methods and processes. 

**myCobot 280-PI**, **myCobot 320-PI**, **myPalletizer 260-PI** and **mechArm 270-PI** devices only need to execute the **mycobot_ros2** installation package.

#### Version selection

ROS2 has a one-to-one correspondence with Ubuntu. Different versions of Ubuntu correspond to different versions of ROS2. For reference, see the following website: [http://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Releases.html](http://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Releases.html)

Here are the ROS2 versions supported by Ubuntu:

| ROS2 version | Release date | Maintenance deadline | Ubuntu version |
| :--------: | :------------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Foxy | June 5, 2020 | May 2023 | Ubuntu 20.04(Focal Fossa) |
| Galactic | May 23, 2021 | November 2022 | Ubuntu 20.04(Focal Fossa) |
| Humble | May 23, 2022 | May 2027 | Ubuntu 22.04(Jammy Jellyfish) |

**Please install the corresponding ROS2 version according to the Ubuntu version you installed, moveIt2 only supports the humble version**

If the versions are different, the download will fail. Here we choose Ubuntu 20.04 (recommended), and the corresponding ROS2 version is ROS2 Foxy

>NOTE: Currently we do not provide any reference for installing ROS2 on Windows. If necessary, please refer to [http://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Alternatives/Windows-Development-Setup.html](http://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Alternatives/Windows-Development-Setup.html)

#### Start installation

##### 1 Add source

There is no ROS2 in the software source list of Ubuntu itself Software source, so you need to first **configure the ROS2 software source to the software list warehouse** before you can download ROS2. Open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), enter the following command:

- Official source:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

- If the download speed is slow, it is recommended to select a mirror source nearby to replace the above command. For example, Huawei Cloud is:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://repo.huaweicloud.com/ros2/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

##### 2 Set the key

**Configure the public network key**, this step is to let the system confirm that our path is safe, so that there is no problem downloading the file, otherwise it will be deleted immediately after downloading:

```bash
sudo apt install curl gnupg2 -y
curl -s https://gitee.com/ohhuo/rosdistro/raw/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

##### 3 Installation

After adding the new software source, you need to **update the software source list**, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Execute **install ROS2**, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), please enter the following command according to your Ubuntu version:

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 foxy version
sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 galactic version
sudo apt install ros-galactic-desktop
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04 humble version
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

**The installation process takes a long time, please wait patiently**

After the installation is complete, refresh the environment variables:

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

#### 1.1.3 Set up the ros2 environment

In order to avoid the need to re-validate the ROS2 function path every time the terminal window is closed, we can **configure the path to the environment variable**, so that the ROS2 function path can be automatically validated every time a new terminal is opened. Execute the following commands in the terminal in sequence, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 foxy version
# Add the ros environment to the environment variables of the current console
echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 galactic version
echo "source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04 humble version
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

##### Install ROS2 additional dependencies

Enter the following command in the terminal **Install ROS2 additional dependencies**, open a console terminal (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>):

```bash
sudo apt install python3-argcomplete -y
```

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-xacro
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 foxy version
sudo apt install ros-foxy-joint-state-publisher-gui
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 galactic version
sudo apt install ros-galactic-joint-state-publisher-gui
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04 humble version
sudo apt install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui
sudo apt install ros-humble-xacro
```

#### Verify installation

To verify ROS2 To check whether the installation is successful, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
ros2
```

When the following interface is displayed, it means that ROS2 is installed successfully

## 3 mycobot_ros2 installation

`mycobot_ros2` is a ROS2 package launched by ElephantRobotics, which is compatible with its desktop six-axis robot arm mycobot series.

Project address: [http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2](http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2)

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Before installing the package, please ensure that you have a ros2 workspace.

Here we give **sample commands for creating a workspace**. Open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command in the command line:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/colcon_ws/src # Create a folder
```

**Add workspace environment**

The official default ROS2 workspace is `colcon_ws`.

```bash
echo "source ~/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3.2 Installation

**NOTE:**

- This package depends on ROS2 and MoveIT2. Make sure to install ROS2 and MoveIT2 successfully before using it.
- The interaction between this package and the real robot arm depends on PythonApi - `pymycobot`
- The Api project is: [https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot)
- Quick installation: `pip install pymycobot --upgrade`

When executing the pip install pymycobot --upgrade command, if the following error message appears:

<img src =../../../../resources\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\ROS\ROS2\ros2install/ros-5.png
width ="500" align = "center">

Enter the following command to install pip according to the prompt

```bash
sudo apt install python-pip
```
- If your Ubuntu system is version 20.04, please execute the command `sudo apt install python3-pip` to install pip
After pip is installed, execute it again in the terminal

```bash
pip install pymycobot --upgrade
```

- The installation method depends on Git, please make sure Git is installed on your computer.

The official default ROS2 workspace is `colcon_ws`.

```bash
cd colcon_ws/src # Enter the src folder in the workspace
# Clone the code on github
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2.git
cd .. # Return to the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install # Build the code in the workspace, --symlink-install: avoid recompiling every time you adjust the python script
source install/setup.bash # Add environment variables
```

## 4 Update the mycobot_ros2 package

To ensure that users can use the latest official package in a timely manner, you can enter the `/home/er/colcon_ws/src` folder through the file manager, open the console terminal (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command to update:

```bash
# Clone the code on github
cd colcon_ws/src # Enter the src folder in the workspace
# Clone the code on github
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2.git
cd .. # Return to the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install # Build the code in the workspace, --symlink-install: avoid recompiling every time you adjust the python script
source install/setup.bash # Add environment variables
```

**Note:** If the `mycobot_ros2` folder already exists in the `/home/er/colcon_ws/src (equivalent to ~/colcon_ws/src)` directory, you need to delete the original `mycobot_ros2` first, and then execute the above command. Among them, `er` in the directory path is the system user name. If there is any inconsistency, please modify it.

To reduce compilation time, you can compile a certain package separately, where `package_name` is the name of the specific package. Please modify it according to your actual situation.

```bash
cd ~/colcon_ws
colcon build --packages-select package_name
source install/setup.bash
```
