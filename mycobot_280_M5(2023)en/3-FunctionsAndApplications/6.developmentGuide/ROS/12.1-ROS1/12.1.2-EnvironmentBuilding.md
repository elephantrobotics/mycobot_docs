##  ROS environment setup

### ROS installation

The basic development environment setup requires the installation of the robot operating system ROS, MoveIt, and git version manager. The following describes their installation methods and processes.

For **myCobot 280-M5** and **myCobot 320-M5** devices, please refer to the installation methods and processes described below. 

#### Version selection

ROS has a one-to-one correspondence with Ubuntu. Different versions of Ubuntu correspond to different versions of ROS. For reference, see the following website: [http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions](http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions)

+ Here are the ROS versions supported by Ubuntu:
+ Ubuntu 16.04 / ROS Kinetic
+ Ubuntu 18.04 / ROS Melodic
+ Ubuntu 20.04 / ROS Noetic

**Please install the corresponding ROS version according to the Ubuntu version you installed**

If the versions are different, the download will fail. Here we choose Ubuntu 18.04, and the corresponding ROS version is ROS Melodic

>NOTE: We currently do not provide any reference for installing ROS on Windows. If necessary, please refer to [https://www.ros.org/install/](https://www.ros.org/install/)

#### Start installation

##### 1 Add source

There is no ROS software source in the software source list of Ubuntu itself, so you need to **configure the ROS software source to the software list warehouse** before you can download ROS. Open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), enter the following command:

- Official source:
```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

- If the download speed is slow, it is recommended to select a mirror source nearby to replace the above command. For example, Tsinghua University is:
  
```bash
sudo sh -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ros/ubuntu/ `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

You will be asked to enter the user password here. Just enter the user password you set when installing Ubuntu.
##### 2 Set up the secret key

**Configure the public network secret key**. This step is to let the system confirm that our path is safe, so that there is no problem downloading the file, otherwise it will be deleted immediately after downloading:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
```

The execution results are shown below:：

<img src =../../../../resources\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\ROS\ROS1/install-ros-1040.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

##### 3 Installation

After adding a new software source, you need to **update the software source list**, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```



Execute **Install ROS**, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command according to your Ubuntu version:

```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

It is recommended to install the complete ROS to prevent missing libraries and dependencies.

**The installation process takes a long time, please be patient**

- If the following error message appears in the console terminal during the installation, you need to change the software source list in /etc/apt/sources.list.
- <img src =../../../../resources\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\ROS\ROS1/ros-2.png

```

**The installation process takes a long time, please wait patiently**

##### 4 Configure ROS environment to the system

rosdep allows you to easily install the source code you want to compile or the system dependencies required by some ROS core components. Execute the following commands in the terminal in sequence to open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>).

If rosdep is not installed on your system, please use the command `sudo apt install python-rosdep` to install it.

If your installed Ubuntu system is version 20.04, please use the command `sudo apt install python3-rosdep` to install it, and execute the rosdep initialization command after completion.
<img src =../../../../resources\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\ROS\ROS1/install-ros-5.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

**Initialize rosdep**:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```

If the error message shown below appears:

<img src =../../../../resources\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\ROS\ROS1/install-ros-6.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

**Solution:** Modify the hosts file and enter the following command in the console terminal:

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/hosts
```

At the end of the file content, add the IP addresses of the following two websites to access:

```bash
199.232.28.133 raw.githubusercontent.com
151.101.228.133 raw.github.com
```

After the modification is completed, execute in the console terminal:

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```
```bash
rosdep update
```

After initialization is completed, in order to avoid the need to re-validate the ROS function path every time the terminal window is closed, we can **configure the path to the environment variable**, so that the ROS function path can be automatically validated every time a new terminal is opened.
Execute the following commands in the terminal in sequence to open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>):
#### Set up the ros environment
##### Bash

Execute the following command:
```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04
# Add the ros environment to the environment variables of the current console
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc  
```
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
##### Install ROS additional dependencies

Enter the following command in the terminal to install ROS additional dependencies and open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>):

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
```

If your Unbutu system is version 20.04, please execute the following command to install it:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
```

```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-joint-state-publisher-gui 
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04 
sudo apt install ros-melodic-joint-state-publisher-gui 
```
```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 
sudo apt install ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher-gui   
```

#### Verify the installation

The startup of the ROS system requires a ROS Master, i.e., a node manager. We can start the ROS Master by entering the roscore command in the terminal.

To verify whether ROS is successfully installed, open a console terminal (shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
roscore
```

When the following interface is displayed, it means that ROS is installed successfully

<img src =../../../../resources\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\ROS\ROS1/install-ros-7.png
width ="500"  align = "center">

The roscore command starts a node manager, which is used for node management. In a ros system, there is only one node manager, which is the prerequisite for the operation of the ros node. Therefore, before starting the ros node, the first step is to execute roscore.


_For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the official installation guide at: [http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
