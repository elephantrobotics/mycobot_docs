## Structural installation and fixation

During the movement of the **robot arm**, if the **bottom surface of myCobot is not connected to the desktop or other bottom surface**, myCobot will still **shake or overturn**.

**There are three common ways to fix the robot arm**:

1) Use the Lego key to fix it on a base with a Lego interface
We sell two types of bases: flat suction cup base and G-clip base
![Base](../../resources/2-BasicSettings/4.FirstTimeInstallation/stand.jpg)
​ Flat base Applicable model: myCobot 280

* Install suction cups at the four corners of the base and tighten them.

* Use the included Lego technology parts to connect the flat base and the bottom of the robot arm.

* Fix the four suction cups on a flat and smooth surface before starting to use.

* Tips: You can add a small amount of non-conductive liquid under the suction cup to fill the gap between the suction cup and the desktop to obtain the best adsorption effect.

![G base](../../resources/2-BasicSettings/4.FirstTimeInstallation/GStand.jpg)

- Use the G-clip to fix the base to the edge of the table

The robot needs to be fixed on a solid base for normal use. Base weight requirement: fixed base or mobile base.

Please make sure there are corresponding threaded holes on the fixed base before installation.

Before formal installation, please confirm:

* The installation environment meets the requirements of the above "Working Environment and Conditions" table.

* The installation location is not less than the robot's working range, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance, and repair.

* Place the base in a suitable position.

* The installation related tools are ready, such as screws, wrenches, etc.
**After confirming the above content**, please move the robot to the base installation table, adjust the robot position, and align the robot base fixing holes with the holes on the base installation table. After aligning the holes, align the screws with the holes and tighten them.

* Note: When adjusting the robot position on the base installation table, please try to avoid pushing and pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, please try to avoid applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.
