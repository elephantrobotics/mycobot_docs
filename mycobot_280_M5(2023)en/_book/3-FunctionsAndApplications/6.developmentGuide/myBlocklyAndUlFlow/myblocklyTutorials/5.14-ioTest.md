# IO test

<i>Preparation before starting</i>

M5Stack series: Make sure the robot arm is connected to the computer (for details, please refer to myBlockly chapter.

Others: Make sure the machine is normal

To use the IO test function, myblockly needs to be updated to v3.3.5

### Learning content in this chapter

How to use myBlockly to quickly test whether io is normal.

Currently, the gripper test function is only compatible with the following models: myCobot 280 series, mecharm 270 series, myPalletizer 260 series, myArm 300 Pi.

Here, take mecharm 270 M5 as an example.

**myblockly connects to the machine serial port**

**Open IO test**

**Select IO type**

Our current model is M5, so select M5 type. You can choose ATOM and BASIC in the M5 category. Here we choose ATOM

**Select ATOM IO**

meacharm 270 M5 Atom IO ports are currently only open 23 and 33

**Operate IO status**

You can click the `Low Level` `High Level` buttons to change the current selection io port status

Set high and low levels and send the command successfully

After changing the io status, you can read the Atom io high and low levels through the building block to check whether it is successful
