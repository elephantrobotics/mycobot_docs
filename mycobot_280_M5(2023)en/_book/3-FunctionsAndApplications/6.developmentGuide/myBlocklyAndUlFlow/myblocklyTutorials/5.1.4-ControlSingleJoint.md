How to use myBlockly to control the single joint motion of the robot

#### API introduction

* Method module: `Set joint`

<img src="../../../../resources\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\myBlocklyAndUlFlow\myblocklyTutorials\singlearm/set joint API 2.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Applicable scope: myCobot280 series, myCobot320 series, mechArm series, myPalletizer series

* Parameter introduction:

This method has three parameters that can be adjusted:

* Joint parameters: The parameter range of myCobot280 series, myCobot320 series and mechArm series is: 1-6; the parameter range of myPalletizer series is: 1-4 (corresponding to the joints of the robot arm)

- Angle parameters: refer to the parameters of the corresponding model

- Speed: Control the speed of the robot arm movement, the parameter range is: 0~100

* Purpose: Control the movement of a single joint of the robot arm

#### Simple demonstration

* The graphic code is as follows:

* Implementation content:

Control the robot arm 1 joint, run to the position of 1 joint angle 20 at a speed of 50, after one second,

Control the robot arm 2 joint, run to the position of 2 joint angle 20 at a speed of 50, after one second,

Control the robot arm 3 joint, run to the position of 3 joint angle 20 at a speed of 50, after one second,

Control the robot arm 4 joint, run to the position of 4 joint angle 20 at a speed of 50, after one second,

Return all joints of the robot arm to the origin at a speed of 60, and end the program.
