## 1.2 Driver Installation

Users can click the button below to download the corresponding **CP210X** or **CP34X** driver package according to their operating system. After decompressing the package, select the installation package corresponding to the operating system bit number for installation.

There are currently two driver chip versions, **CP210X** (for CP2104 version) and **CP34X** (for CH9102 version) driver package. If you are not sure which USB chip your device uses, you can install both drivers at the same time. ( During the installation process, an error may appear for **CH9102_VCP_SER_MacOS**, but the installation has actually been completed, so just ignore it.)

For Mac OS, before installing, make sure that the system "Preferences->Security and Privacy->General" is set and that it allows downloads from the App Store and approved developers.

## 1.3 How to distinguish CP210X and CP34X chips

- As shown in the figure below, open **Device Manager** and check **Ports (COM and LPT)**

![frimware_check](../../../resources/3-FunctionsAndApplications/5.2-Softwarelnstructions/firmware_check1.gif)

* If **Port (COM and LPT)** shows **USB-Enhanced-SERIAL CH9102**, it is **CP34X chip**
