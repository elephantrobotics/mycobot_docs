### System basic function description

### Robot system introduction

- **System introduction**

- Ubuntu is the most widely used Linux operating system in personal desktop operating systems. For beginners, it is a good choice to be familiar with the Linux environment or some embedded hardware operating systems. The Ubuntu official website also released a dedicated operating system for Raspberry Pi.

- Enter the new password twice

### VNC

- **VNC function introduction**

- It is a remote control software, generally used to remotely solve computer problems or software debugging

- **VNC port description**

- The robot arm and PC are connected to the same WiFi, and the robot arm IP address is the port

- **Connect VNC**

- There are two ways to connect. The first way requires an external monitor to perform some operations on the system. The specific steps are as follows:

First click **"Disconnect"** to turn off the default hotspot

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-1.png" align = center style="zoom:80%;" />

Click **"Enable Wi-Fi"** and wait for the currently available WiFi to be displayed

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-2.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

Click the WiFi you want to connect to and enter the WiFi password

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-3.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

After the connection is successful, click **"Connection Information"** to query the current IP address of the robot

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-4.png" align = center style="zoom:80%;" />

As shown in the example, **"192.168.10.64"** is the current IP address of the robot

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-5.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

Connect your computer and the robot's WiFi to the same WiFi and open VNC viewer software, enter this IP address (in the above case, enter **192.168.10.64**) and press Enter. The password is Elephant. The user name is not filled in by default. The successful connection example is as follows:

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-4 (1).png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

- The second method does not require connecting to the display screen. Directly connect the PC to the Ubuntu system hotspot for remote control. However, this connection method does not have the function of surfing the Internet. It can only remotely control the robotic arm system. The specific steps are as follows:

PC selects to connect to the Ubuntu system hotspot **ElephantRobotics_AP_XXXX**, and enters the password **Elephant**

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-5 (1).png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

Open the VNC viewer software, enter the IP address **10.42.0.1**, and then press Enter. The password is Elephant. The user name is not filled in by default. The successful connection example is as follows:

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-6 (1).png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

- **How ​​to improve fluency**

- The fluency of remote connection depends on the fluency of the connected WiFi. It is recommended to connect to a stable WiFi for remote control

### SSH

- **SSH Function Introduction**

- Simply put, SSH is a network protocol used for encrypted login between computers. If a user logs in to another remote computer from a local computer using the SSH protocol, we can assume that this login is secure, and even if it is intercepted in the middle, the password will not be leaked.

- **SSH port description**

- Default port is 22, no need to change

- **SSH first connection**

- Follow **2.3 VNC** to confirm the IP address of the robot

- Press `win + R` on the personal computer to open the run interface, and enter `cmd` in the input box
<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/ssh1.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
- After entering, click OK to open the shell interface
<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/ssh-2.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
- Enter `ssh er@IP address` , then press Enter (the IP address is mainly displayed on the robot arm, the picture is just an example)
<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/ssh-3.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
- Enter the password `Elephant`
<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/ssh-4.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
- As shown in the above picture, the remote ssh connection to the robot arm has been successfully completed

- **How ​​to improve fluency**

- The fluency of the remote connection depends on the fluency of the connected WiFi. It is recommended to connect to a stable WiFi for remote control

### Network configuration

- **Use of default AP**

- After the robot is turned on, the system will connect to the hotspot emitted by the Raspberry Pi by default. The hotspot name is **ElephantRobotics_AP_XXXX**, and the IP address is **10.42.0.1**. This hotspot does not have the function of surfing the Internet, and the transmission rate and amount of information are limited, so there will be some distortion and color difference in the final image, and the communication transmission will also be delayed, which is a normal phenomenon.

- **Connect to WLAN**

First click **"Disconnect"** to turn off the default hotspot

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-1.png" align = center style="zoom:80%;" />

Click **"Enable Wi-Fi"** and wait for the currently available WiFi to be displayed

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/2.1.5.4-1-012.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

Click the WiFi you want to connect to and enter the WiFi password

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/2.1.5.4-1-013.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/VNC4.png" align = center style="zoom:80%;" />

As shown in the example, **“192.168.10.64”** is the current IP address of the robot

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/VNC5.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

- **Connect to a wired network**

After the robot is turned on, it connects to the system-configured hotspot by default: **ElephantRobotics_AP_XXXX**

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/2.1.5.4-1-007.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

Click **“Disconnect”** to disconnect the default hotspot connection

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/connect-1 (1).png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/2.1.5.4-1-008.png" align = "center" style="zoom:15%;" />

Connect a regular Internet cable to the network port of the robot

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/2.1.5.4-1-009.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

- **How ​​to set the default IP address**

Use the shortcut keys `ctrl + alt + T` to open the terminal, enter `sudo vim /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml`, and modify the 01-network-manager-all.yaml file to the following content

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/ip-1.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />

After the modification is completed, enter `sudo netplan apply` to make the configuration effective

- **How ​​to automatically assign IP addresses**

When the system is connected to WiFi, the IP address is automatically assigned without any settings. If you want to change from a fixed IP address to an automatically assigned IP address, modify the /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml file to the following content

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\5.BasicFunction\5.2-Softwarelnstructions/ip-2.png" align = "center" style="zoom:80%;" />
