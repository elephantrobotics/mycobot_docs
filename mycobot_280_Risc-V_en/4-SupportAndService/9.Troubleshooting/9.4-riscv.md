# Risc-V platform development issues

## 1 About power supply

**Q: When running AiKit program with artificial intelligence kit, the system black screen restarts. What's the matter?**

- A: When AI and suction pump control related programs are running, the power consumption of the development board CPU will increase significantly. If the power adapter is insufficient, it may cause voltage instability, causing the system to black screen or restart.

Solution:

- Please make sure to use the power adapter provided by Spacemit to power the development board separately, and avoid using an insufficient power supply or PC power supply.

- If there is no official power adapter for the development board, check whether the output specifications of the power adapter used meet the requirements of the development board (usually 5V/3A or higher).

## 2 About the driver

**Q: After powering on, the development board does not recognize the robotic arm device?**

- A: Open the terminal of the device and execute `ls -al /dev/tty*` to check whether the robotic arm is recognized. If it is not recognized, please open the serial port and execute the following command to install the driver:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch343ser_linux.git
cd ch343ser_linux/driver
sudo make install
```

After installing the driver, restart the power, and the robot arm device number should be recognized as `/dev/ttyCH343USB*`.

**Q: The software program of myCobot 280 Risc-V uses `/dev/ttyAMA0` as the serial port device number by default. How to solve the problem that it does not match the actual device number?**

- A: You can set a soft link for the device in two ways:

(1) Temporarily set a symbolic link: Assuming the actual device number is `/dev/ttyCH343USB0`, open the terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
sudo ln -s /dev/ttyCH343USB0 /dev/ttyAMA0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyCH343USB0
```

The above command links the device `/dev/ttyCH343USB0` to `/dev/ttyAMA0`. The symbolic link created in this way is temporary and will become invalid after the system is restarted. If you need it to take effect permanently, please use method 2.

(2) Use udev rules to permanently set a symbolic link: Open the terminal and execute `lsusb` to view the USB information of the robot arm. Assume the output is as follows:

```bash
Bus 001 Device 007: ID 1a86:55d3 QinHeng Electronics USB Single Serial
```

`1a86` is the vendor ID and `55d3` is the product ID. Create udev rule file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTRS{idProduct}=="55d3", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="ttyAMA0"
```

Save and reload udev rules and trigger device events:

```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Reinsert the USB device and check whether the symbolic link is created successfully:

```
ls -l /dev/ttyAMA0
```

**Q: Running the program prompts `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyAMA0'` How to solve it?**

- A: Make sure the device has read and write permissions. Assuming that the actual device number of the robot arm is `/dev/ttyCH343USB0`, execute the following command to modify the device permissions:

```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyCH343USB0
```

**Q: When the robot arm controls the suction pump, it prompts `lgpio.error: 'can not open gpiochip'` How to solve it?**

- A: Make sure the GPIO device is loaded:

```
ls -al /dev/gpiochip0
```

Make sure the GPIO device has read and write permissions:

```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/gpiochip0
```

**Q: Camera device reports an error `open VIDEOIO(V4L2:/dev/video20): can't open camera by index` How to solve it?**

- A: Make sure the Camera device exists:

```
ls -al /dev/video20
```

Make sure the Camera device has read and write permissions:

```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/video20
```
