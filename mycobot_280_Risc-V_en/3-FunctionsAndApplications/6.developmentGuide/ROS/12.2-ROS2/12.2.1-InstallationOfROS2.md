# ROS2 environment installation

myCobot 280 RISC-V version comes with Bianbu (Ubuntu 24.04) system and built-in development environment. No need to build and manage, just update the `mycobot_ros2` package.

`mycobot_ros2` is the ROS2 package launched by Elephant Robotics for its mycobot series of desktop six-axis robotic arms.

## Update mycobot_ros2 package

To ensure that users can use the latest official package in a timely manner, you can enter the `/home/sunrise/colcon_ws/src` folder through the file manager, open the console terminal (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command to update:

```bash
# Clone the code on github
cd colcon_ws/src # Enter the src folder in the workspace
# Clone the code on github
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2.git
cd .. # Return to the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install # Build the code in the workspace, --symlink-install: avoid recompiling every time you adjust the python script
source install/setup.bash # Add environment variables
```

To save compilation time, you can choose to compile a certain package separately:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select package name
```

For example, only compile the `mycobot_280_risc_v` package:

```bash
cd ~/colcon_ws
colcon build --packages-select mycobot_280_risc_v
source install/setup.bash
```

**Note:** If the `mycobot_ros2` folder already exists in the `/home/elephant/colcon_ws/src (equivalent to ~/colcon_ws/src)` directory, you need to delete the original `mycobot_ros2` first, and then execute the above command. Among them, `elephant` in the directory path is the system user name. If there is any inconsistency, please modify it.

At this point, the ROS2 environment is built. For the use of ROS2, please refer to [the Rviz introduction and use section](12.2.4-rivzIntroductionAndUse/README.md).
