# Use of suction pump

<i>Preparation before starting</i>

Ensure that it is used in the myCobot 280 RISC-V robotic arm

Please refer to **Accessories** for the introduction and installation of the suction pump. The compatible robotic arm models for the suction pump include myCobot 280, myPalletizer 260, and mechArm 270. Taking the myCobot 280 RISC-V robotic arm as an example for illustration.

#### API display

**Note**: If the module does not match the model, the program will report an error (as shown in the following figure).

* Method module **1**: `Pin signal set as input or output device`

<img src="../../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\myBlocklyAndUlFlow\io\pin-type.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Applicable to: Raspberry Pi versions of myCobot 280 series, myPalletizer 260 series and mechArm 270 series
* Parameter introduction:
* Mode parameter: can enter "BCM" or "BOARD" mode
* Purpose: Set the Raspberry Pi GPIO pin mode

<br>

* Method module **2**: Pin level setting`

<img src="../../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\myBlocklyAndUlFlow\io\pin-level.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Scope of application: Only applicable to myCobot 280 RISC-V robotic arm

* Parameter introduction:

This module has two parameters that can be adjusted:

* Pin number: specific pin number at the bottom of the device (corresponding pin number can be selected)
* Level status: HIGH is set to high level, LOW is set to low level (suction pump starts working at low level, stops working at high level)

* Purpose: Set the pins to high and low levels

<br>

* Method module **3**: ` Read pin level value (high/low level)`

<img src="../../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\myBlocklyAndUlFlow\io\pin-read.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Scope of application: Only applicable to myCobot 280 RISC-V robotic arm

* Parameter introduction:

This module has a parameter that can be adjusted:

* Pin number: specific pin number at the bottom of the device (corresponding pin number can be selected)

* Purpose: To obtain the level value of the pin (high: 1; low: 0)
<br>

* Method module **4**: ` Turn off pin`

<img src="../../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\myBlocklyAndUlFlow\io\pin-close.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Scope of application: Only applicable to myCobot 280 RISC-V robotic arm

* Parameter introduction:

This module has a parameter that can be adjusted:

* Pin number: specific pin number at the bottom of the device (corresponding pin number can be selected)

* Purpose: To turn off the pin (note: turning off the pin will stop high and low level operation, and high and low level settings and reading level values cannot be performed again)

**Vertical Suction Pump V2.0**

* The graphic code is as follows: Only applicable to myCobot 280 RISC-V robotic arm
* Pin 72 controls the operation of the suction pump

* Implementation content:
First, set pin 72 as the output device, and then set pin 72 to a low level. At this point, the suction pump vibrates and starts working. The suction pump picks up objects and can read whether the pin number status is low. After working for three seconds, set pin 72 to high level. The suction pump will stop working and the object will be lowered. Read whether the pin status is high level. After one second, turn off pin 72 and the program ends.
