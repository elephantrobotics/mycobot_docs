# Chapter 5 Basic Functions

**This chapter mainly explains the basic functions and usage of the product and the use of basic software. This chapter is very important and should be read carefully in order. Before actually applying the robot, please make sure you understand the described operations correctly. **

ER myCobot 280 Jetson Nano uses NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ core development version as the main control, with built-in Ubuntu Mate 20.04 operating system. It does not need to be equipped with an additional PC main control. It can be used by directly connecting the display, keyboard, and mouse. It can be regarded as a miniature computer host. The host and the host cannot simply communicate through a single line. It can only be connected to an independent display, and equipped with a power supply, mouse, and keyboard, and then developed and operated after entering the built-in system of the development board.
