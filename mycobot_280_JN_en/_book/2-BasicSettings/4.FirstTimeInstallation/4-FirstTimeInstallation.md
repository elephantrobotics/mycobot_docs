## 3. Startup Inspection Guide

## 3.1 Structural Installation and Fixing

During the movement of the **robot arm**, if the **bottom surface of myCobot is not connected to the desktop or other bottom surface**, myCobot will still **shake or overturn**.

**There are three common ways to fix the robot arm**:

1) Use Lego keys to fix it on a base with a Lego interface

We sell two types of bases: flat suction cup base and G-type clamp base
![Base](../../resource/2-BasicSettings/4.FirstTimeInstallation/stand.jpg)
​ Flat base Applicable model: myCobot 280

* Install suction cups at the four corners of the base and tighten them.

* Use the included Lego technology parts to connect the flat base and the bottom of the robot arm.

* Fix the four suction cups on a flat and smooth surface before starting to use.
* Tips: You can add a small amount of non-conductive liquid under the suction cup to fill the gap between the suction cup and the desktop to achieve the best adsorption effect.

G-type base Applicable models: myCobot 280, myPalletizer 260

![G base](../../resource/2-BasicSettings/4.FirstTimeInstallation/GStand.jpg)

- Use the G-shaped clip to fix the base to the edge of the table

- Use the included Lego technology parts to connect the base and the bottom of the robot arm

- Make sure it is stable before starting to use

2 myCobot base screw hole connection

The robot needs to be fixed on a solid base before it can be used normally. Base weight requirements: fixed base, or mobile base.

Please make sure that there are corresponding threaded holes on the fixed base before installation.

Before formal installation, please confirm:

* The installation environment meets the requirements of the above "Working Environment and Conditions" table.

* The installation location is not less than the robot's working range, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance, and repair.

* Place the base in a suitable position.

* The installation-related tools are ready, such as screws, wrenches, etc.

**After confirming the above content**, please move the robot to the base installation table, adjust the robot position, and align the robot base fixing holes with the holes on the base installation table. After aligning the holes, align the screws with the holes and tighten them.

* Note: When adjusting the robot position on the base installation table, please try to avoid pushing and pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, please try to avoid applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.

# 4. Power on and preliminary inspection

## 4.1 Power on the robot

Before operation, please make sure that you have read and followed the contents of **Chapter 1 Safety Instructions** to ensure safe operation. At the same time, connect the power adapter to the robot arm and fix the base of the robot arm on the table. The connection method is shown in Figure 3-1:

<img src="../../resource/2-BasicSettings/4.FirstTimeInstallation/2.1.7.3-2-001.jpg" alt="2.1.7.3-2-001" style="zoom:10%;" />

Figure 3-1

myCobot **must be powered by an external power supply** to provide sufficient power:

- Rated voltage: 12V
- Rated current: 3-5A
- Plug type: DC 5.5mm x 2.1

Note that **it cannot be powered by just the TypeC plugged into the M5Stack-basic**. Use an officially-adapted power supply to avoid damage to the robot arm.

## 4.2 Connect external devices

Use the matching HDMI cable to connect the robot arm and the monitor:

- First insert the HDMI cable into the HDMI port of the monitor.
