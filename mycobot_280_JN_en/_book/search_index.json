Safety Instructions\nIntroduction\nThis chapter details general safety information for personnel who perform installation, maintenance and repair work on the Elephant Robot. Please fully read and understand the contents and precautions of this chapter before handling, installing and using it.\nHazard Identification\nThe safety of collaborative robots is based on the premise of correctly configuring and using the robots. Moreover, even if all safety instructions are followed, injuries or damage to the operator may still occur. Therefore, it is very important to understand the safety hazards of robot use, which is conducive to preventing them before they happen.\nTables 1-1 to 3 below are common safety hazards that may exist when using robots:\nTable 1-1 Dangerous safety hazards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Personal injury or robot damage caused by incorrect operation during robot handling.\n\n\n2 Failure to fix the robot as required, such as lack of screws or screws not tightened, insufficient base locking capacity to stably support the robot for high-speed movement, etc., may cause the robot to fall over, resulting in personal injury or robot damage.\n\n\n3 Failure to correctly configure the robot's safety functions, or insufficient installation of safety protection tools, etc., may cause the robot's safety functions to fail to function, thus causing danger.\n\n\n\nTable 1-2 Warning-level safety hazards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Do not stay in the robot's motion range when debugging the program. Improper safety configuration may not be able to avoid collisions that may cause personal injury.\n\n\n2 The connection between the robot and other equipment may cause new hazards, and a comprehensive risk assessment needs to be re-performed.\n\n\n3 Scratches and punctures caused by sharp surfaces such as other equipment or the robot's end effector in the working environment.\n\n\n4 The robot is a precision machine, and stepping on it may cause damage to the robot.\n\n\n5 Failure to clamp the object in place or not removing the clamped object before turning off the robot power or air source (not confirming whether the end effector is firm and the clamped object falls due to power loss) may cause dangers, such as damage to the end effector and injuries to people.\n\n\n6 The robot may move unexpectedly. Do not stand under any axis of the robot under any circumstances!\n\n\n7 The robot is a precision machine. If it is not placed stably during transportation, it may cause vibration, which may cause damage to the robot's internal components.\n\n\n8 Compared with ordinary mechanical equipment, the robot has more degrees of freedom and a larger range of motion. Failure to meet the range of motion may cause unexpected collisions.\n\n\n\nTable 1-3 Safety hazards that may cause electric shock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Using non-original cables may cause unknown dangers.\n\n\n2 Electrical equipment in contact with liquid may cause leakage.\n\n\n3 There may be a risk of electric shock when the electrical connection is incorrect.\n\n\n4 Always turn off the power of the controller and related devices and unplug the power plug before replacing. If the work is carried out in the power-on state, it may cause electric shock or malfunction.\n\n\n\n2. Safety precautions\nThe following safety rules should be followed when using the robot arm:\n\nThe robot arm is a live device. Non-professionals are not allowed to change the circuit at will, otherwise it is easy to cause damage to the equipment or personal injury.\n\nWhen operating the robot arm, local laws and regulations should be strictly observed.

Startup Inspection Guide\n3.1 Structural Installation and Fixing\nDuring the movement of the robot arm, if the bottom surface of myCobot is not connected to the desktop or other bottom surface, myCobot will still shake or overturn.\nThere are three common ways to fix the robot arm:\n1) Use Lego keys to fix it on a base with a Lego interface\nWe sell two types of bases: flat suction cup base and G-type clamp base\n\n​ Flat base Applicable model: myCobot 280\n\nInstall suction cups at the four corners of the base and tighten them.\n\nUse the included Lego technology parts to connect the flat base and the bottom of the robot arm.\n\nFix the four suction cups on a flat and smooth surface before starting to use.\n\nTips: You can add a small amount of non-conductive liquid under the suction cup to fill the gap between the suction cup and the desktop to achieve the best adsorption effect.\n\n\n\nG-type base Applicable models: myCobot 280, myPalletizer 260\n\n\nUse the G-shaped clip to fix the base to the edge of the table\n\nUse the included Lego technology parts to connect the base and the bottom of the robot arm\n\nMake sure it is stable before starting to use\n\n\n\n2 myCobot base screw hole connection\nThe robot needs to be fixed on a solid base before it can be used normally. Base weight requirements: fixed base, or mobile base.\nPlease make sure that there are corresponding threaded holes on the fixed base before installation.\nBefore formal installation, please confirm:\n\nThe installation environment meets the requirements of the above \"Working Environment and Conditions\" table.\n\nThe installation location is not less than the robot's working range, and there is enough space for installation, use, maintenance, and repair.\n\nPlace the base in a suitable position.\n\nThe installation-related tools are ready, such as screws, wrenches, etc.\n\n\nAfter confirming the above content, please move the robot to the base installation table, adjust the robot position, and align the robot base fixing holes with the holes on the base installation table. After aligning the holes, align the screws with the holes and tighten them.\n\nNote: When adjusting the robot position on the base installation table, please try to avoid pushing and pulling the robot directly on the base installation table to avoid scratches. When manually moving the robot, please try to avoid applying external force to the fragile parts of the robot body to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.\n\n\n4. Power on and preliminary inspection\n4.1 Power on the robot\nBefore operation, please make sure that you have read and followed the contents of Chapter 1 Safety Instructions to ensure safe operation. At the same time, connect the power adapter to the robot arm and fix the base of the robot arm on the table. The connection method is shown in Figure 3-1:\n\nFigure 3-1\nmyCobot must be powered by an external power supply to provide sufficient power:\n\nRated voltage: 12V\nRated current: 3-5A\nPlug type: DC 5.5mm x 2.1\n\nNote that it cannot be powered by just the TypeC plugged into the M5Stack-basic. Use an officially-adapted power supply to avoid damage to the robot arm.\n4.2 Connect external devices\nUse the matching HDMI cable to connect the robot arm and the monitor:\n\nFirst insert the HDMI cable into the HDMI port of the monitor.\n\n\n\nThen insert the other end into the HDMI port of the robot arm.\n\n\n\nmyCobot 280 Jetson Nano has 3 USB ports, which can be directly plugged into a mouse, keyboard and other peripherals for use\n\n\n4.3 Power on\nAfter connecting the required external devices, press the button as shown in the circle to start the machine\n\nSystem card description\nThe machine comes with a 64G TF card, built-in Ubuntu20.04 system, myStudio firmware burning software, myBlockly graphical programming software installed, and adapted to python and ROS development environment.\nMake sure you are using a good quality power supply.

If you encounter problems while using the robotic arm, please read the contents of this section first to find solutions. If the listed problems cannot help you solve and you have more after-sales questions, please add the after-sales manager WeChat.\nHow to ask reasonable questions to get solutions\nCommon driver problems and solutions\nCommon software problems and solutions\nCommon hardware problems and solutions\n\nIf you have read all the contents of this chapter, please continue to read the next chapter. \n← Previous Chapter | Next Chapter →\n"},"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.0-how_to_ask.html":{"url":"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.0-how_to_ask.html","title":"4.1 How to Ask for Help Correctly","keywords":"","body":"How to ask questions elegantly1 When asking questions in various places, you will find several phenomena:2 Before asking questions, make sure you have studied the driver-related, software-related and hardware-related chapters in the document3 When asking questions, try to do the following points, which will greatly increase the chances of the problem being solved quickly:4 If the problem cannot be solved by yourself and you need to ask others for help, you need to consider:5 Question template6 Title7 ContentHow to ask questions elegantly\n1 When asking questions in various places, you will find several phenomena:\n\nNo one answers the question after asking\nSomeone answers the question after a long time\nThe other party always complains that you are too new\n\n2 Before asking questions, make sure you have studied the driver-related, software-related and hardware-related chapters in the document\nThe driver-related, software-related and hardware-related chapters in the document are the basis of the basics of using my series. Whether you have development experience or not, whether you are a big shot or a novice, please be sure to read and operate it from beginning to end.\nMany problems will be solved in this process. Don't ask questions casually in QQ groups, forums, issues, or emails at the beginning. Many problems explained at the beginning of the document may not get timely answers from the community. Save everyone's time and for a better community environment, everyone will grow better together. Please understand each other.\n3 When asking questions, try to do the following points, which will greatly increase the chances of the problem being solved quickly:\nClarify the problem, figure out what happened, and what I did, including:\n\nWhat effect and function do I want to achieve?\n\nHow did I achieve this effect, and what is the detailed process?\n\nDuring the implementation process, what errors occurred and what was the phenomenon (for example, an error was reported, what error was reported, and what was the complete error content?)\n\nDid I read the error information carefully, and did the error information indicate the cause of the error and the solution?\n\nBased on these error information, think carefully, can the problem be solved?\n\nSearch documents, issues, and search engines to find solutions to the problem?\n\n\n4 If the problem cannot be solved by yourself and you need to ask others for help, you need to consider:\n\nWho to ask, where to ask, who is more likely to answer my question? And how real-time?\n\nWhat data and phenomena should I provide him so that he is willing to help me solve the problem quickly?\n\nProvide my purpose (to let the respondent know what you are doing)\n\nProvide the complete implementation process and the phenomena that occurred during the process (to make it convenient for the respondent to follow your process and reproduce the problem)\n\nGive the wrong place, and indicate where the phenomenon or result is different from what you expected! (Let the respondent know where the expectation is not met)\n\nProvide the error information that occurred, which needs to be complete, and take as many screenshots and logs as possible. Don't be stingy and take a small picture, or only give part of the log (because the respondent may not have done this for a long time and forget some details. You need to rely on screenshots and complete logs to quickly recall; and according to the detailed log, you can quickly locate where the problem is)\n\nHow to ask questions with a more sincere attitude, even if I am a novice, everyone is willing to answer\n\n\n5 Question template\nTry to ask questions elegantly, without adding extra modal particles, complaining words, consider every word and punctuation, think about the problem from the perspective of the respondent, and how to let the respondent quickly help you solve the problem. Too few words will not be clear, and too many words will make people impatient.\n6 Title\nNo matter where you ask the question (including QQ group), give your question a title of about 30 words, clarifying the central idea of ​​the question, including:\n\nQuestion category, whether it is a question to ask, a bug submission, or experience sharing, etc. Let everyone immediately locate what you want to do on a screen full of text\nExplain the core of the problem in one sentence, such as Running the camera sample program, the error reset fail is reported, it may be a hardware problem\n\nSo the comprehensive title can be like this:\n\n[mycobot asks] Running the camera sample program, the error reset fail is reported, could it be a hardware problem\n\nTry to avoid such titles:\n\nAhhh why is my board not working again\nWhy can't my code run\nWhy is my screen black\n[mycobot asks] I received the development board, the development board screen is red, with a line of small text, why\nI ran the xxx program and there was a problem\n\nYou can ask like this:\n\n[mycobot asks] My board cannot start after I connected the power supply in reverse. How can I determine where the board is burned? If possible, how can I save it\n\n7 Content\nFirst, from the perspective of the respondent, if you are asked a question:\n\nFirst of all, you need to know what the other party wants to do and what goal they want to achieve\nIn order to achieve this goal, what steps did he refer to\nWhat specific steps were actually taken, and then the problem occurred at that step, so that I can follow his steps to try to reproduce the phenomenon. If the problem seems difficult to solve and there are no steps to reproduce it, it may take a lot of time to reproduce it, so put it aside and solve other problems first\nWhat is the specific problem? If he only says that there is a problem, how can I know what problem he has, maybe he is unwell? So this is very important. You need to ask him to explain the phenomenon when the problem occurs and indicate what is different from the expectation. Otherwise, I have to guess and compare what is different from the expectation, which increases the time to solve the problem.\nIf there is a problem, I may need his log file to facilitate me to analyze the source code based on the log. Otherwise, it may be difficult to solve the problem. Then this question can be put aside for later.\n\nIn summary, you can ask questions like this:\n\nElucidate your goals in detail, what you want to do, and what the phenomenon should be\nHave I referred to any documents, codes or tutorials\nHow to reproduce the error: How to do it specifically, write each step in detail until the problem occurs\nElaborate on the phenomenon when the error occurs, and what is different from the expectation, and prove that the problem has indeed occurred\nAttach log files, screenshots, and even videos. The logs and screenshots must be complete. Don't just capture a small part. The answerer may find some problems that you haven't noticed from your complete logs and screenshots. This is very important\nIn addition, pay attention to the format when pasting the code. Don't paste it and it will be messy and unreadable. Try to copy it and run it directly\nFinally, thank the community friends who answered the question\n\n"},"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.1-driver.html":{"url":"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.1-driver.html","title":"4.2 Common Driver Problems and Solutions","keywords":"","body":"Driver related1 About python2 About ROSDriver related\n1 About python\nQ: What do the parameters in send_coords([x,y,z,rx,ry,rz], speed, 1) mean? What do rx, ry, and rz correspond to in Euler angles? What is the rotation order of Euler angles? And what is the value range of each parameter? \n\nA: The parameters in the previous array are the end coordinates of the robot arm, speed is the speed, and the last parameter is the motion mode. rx, ry, and rz should correspond to rpy, which means roll, pitch, and yaw respectively. The order of Euler angles is zyx, and zyx is the local coordinate. The value range of X, Y, and Z is -300 to 300.00 (the value range is undefined, and the inverse kinematics no solution prompt will be returned if it exceeds the range), and the value range of rx, ry, and rz is -180 to 180.\n\nQ: Are sample tutorials for the python API available? \n\nA: Currently there is a demo. There is a test code in the Test folder of github. You can execute it with the terminal. https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot/tree/main/demo\n\nQ: How to run the python drag teaching demo of mycobot280-Pi? \n\nA: Run in the terminal, please enter 1000000 for the baud rate.\n\nQ: Why is there an error in the python zero calibration demo program of mycobot280-Pi? \n\nA: The atom firmware is not burned. Please burn the atom firmware first and then run the program.\n\nQ: Are the python APIs of different versions of the robot arm the same? \n\nA: The API is the same.\n\n2 About ROS\nQ: How do microcontroller-based and microprocessor-based robot arms run ROS? \n\nA: The microcontroller-based robot arm is currently on Ubuntu. We need to download a virtual machine to build a virtual environment and install the Ubuntu system in the virtual environment to run ROS. You can also develop your own ROS. The microprocessor-based robotic arm comes with a ROS environment and can be used directly.\n\nQ: Can the microprocessor-based robotic arm be connected to a PC to use ros and moveit? \n\nA: The current open source data does not have direct communication control. It can be implemented by modifying the existing node files through ros + socket.\n\nQ: Can you provide rviz model files and programming examples? \n\nA: They are provided on our github.\nhttps://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros\n\nQ: Can myAGV remotely build maps?\n\nA: It can be remotely built. We are an open source ROS control interface.\n\nQ: When using ROS to start the rviz model file, why does it report an error permission denied: '/dev/ttyUSB0'? \n\nA: It is because the serial port permission is not given. You should enter sudo chmod 777 port name in the terminal.\n\nQ: When running the slider control and model following commands of ROS, why is the error init() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given) reported? \n\nA: The pymycobot library is not installed and started.\n\nQ: When using ROS, why is the robot arm angle inconsistent with the model angle after opening the rviz model? \n\nA: It is likely that the zero position of the robot arm is not calibrated, and the zero position of the robot arm needs to be calibrated.\n\n"},"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.2-software.html":{"url":"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.2-software.html","title":"4.3 Common software problems and solutions","keywords":"","body":"Software Issues1 About myStudio2 About RoboFlow3 About myCobot phone controller4 About myblockly5 About Arduino6 About ROS1Software Issues\nQ: Why can't my compiler find the corresponding device? \n\nA: You need to build a development environment and install the corresponding project library before you can develop the device.\n\n1 About myStudio\nQ: What is myStudio? \n\nA: It is our company's self-developed software. It is a tool for burning or modifying the firmware of the existing robotic arms launched by our company.\n\nQ: Is there any difference between the firmware used by MyCobot 320 M5-2020 and 2022? \n\nA: The requirements for using the old version 320 firmware are as follows\nM5 version: minirobot1.0+atommain4.2;\nPI version: ubuntu18.04+atommain4.1;\nThe requirements for using the new version 320 firmware are as follows\nM5 version: minirobot2.1+picomain1.0+atommain5.0;\nPI version: ubuntu18.04+picomain1.0+atommain5.0;\nThis firmware combination is up to mystudio version v4.3.1\n\nQ: Why can't the device work properly after I burn the firmware to the ATOM terminal? \n\nA: The firmware of the ATOM terminal needs to use our factory firmware. Other unofficial firmware cannot be changed during use. If the device accidentally burns other firmware, you can use \"myCobot firmware burner\" to select ATOM terminal-select serial port-select ATOMMAIN firmware to burn the ATOM terminal.\n\nQ: Can the drag teaching in the firmware record the gripper action? \n\nA: It is not possible to use drag teaching to record the gripper movements for the time being, because the gripper belongs to joint number 7, and our drag teaching can only record and play the movements of joints numbered 1-6.\n\nQ: Why can't drag teaching be performed after burning the minirobot firmware? \n\nA: First check whether both the M5Stack-basic firmware and the atom firmware have been burned, whether the burned firmware corresponds to the requirements to be implemented, and whether the burned firmware is the latest version.\nIt is recommended to burn the minirobot firmware to version v2.1 and the top atommain firmware to version v4.1 and above (need to support mystudio version v4.3.1 and above).\n\nQ: What should I do if mycobot's serial port cannot be recognized on mystudio? \n\nA: If your computer device does not prompt for the connected robot arm, please install the serial port driver first.\nIt should also be noted that the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Jetson nano series robot arms are cannot be connected to a laptop using a data cable, and need to use mystudio in the built-in system for firmware burning.\n\nQ: Can I save the recorded trajectory of drag teaching to the card? \n\nA: Currently, it cannot be saved to the memory card. And drag teaching can only save one path at a time, and the next recording will overwrite the previous action.\n\n2 About RoboFlow\nQ: Can robotStudio software programming be used? \n\nA: Our own industrial programming software roboFlow can be used. RobotStudio is from ABB and cannot communicate with us.\n\nQ: What is the reason for the rapid movement of roboFlow software beyond the limit? \n\nA: It may be that one or more joints exceed the limit.\n\nQ: How does roboflow load the already written program? \n\nA: After logging in, select program robot, and then click load program. Clicking run program directly does not work, only pro600 can.\n\nQ: When pro600 uses roboflow, the log shows that 456 joints have stopped. Is this normal? \n\nA: This is a normal phenomenon.\n\n3 About myCobot phone controller\nQ: What version of firmware should be burned in myCobot phone controller app? \n\nA: You need to burn atom firmware atommain2.5 version in mystudio.\n(As of now, the mobile APP control function has been disabled. Please pay attention to the firmware version information of mystudio for the restart time.)\n\n4 About myblockly\nQ: When myblockly is running, child process exited with code 0 always appears. Why? \n\nA: This is not an error. The real error needs to be analyzed according to the specific situation. This string of characters represents the end of the program running, and the binary number 0 is returned, which means termination.\n\n5 About Arduino\nQ: Arduino program running error: multiple libraries are corresponding and MycobotSaver.h file cannot be found\n\nA: First of all, the first error is that multiple libraries are corresponding, prompting used and unused libraries. Just delete one library.\nThere is another error that MycobotSaver.h is not found. This is a problem with the library name. You need to change it to MyCobotSaver.h.\nThis program may have been used before, and the file name has been changed later. You can find the MyCobotSaver file, and then copy and paste the found MyCobotSaver file into the myCobotProBasic folder.\n\nQ: 280Arduino control method\n-A: 1. Yes, if you use the uno board, you do need arduino to control it. For the mkrwifi1010 mega2560 board, you can use python or ros.\n\nThe uno board is connected to the arduino board via a Dupont line, and cannot be directly plugged in.\nOur arduino has a case that you can use directly. I will give you a link and screenshot, and you can burn it directly into the uno board. If you want to develop other arduino programs yourself, you can directly compile the last case with the Arduino software. The tutorial is in this part.\n\n6 About ROS1\nQ: When the terminal switches to ~/catkin_ws/src and uses git to install and update mycobot_ros, the target path \"mycobot_ros\" already exists. What is the reason? \n\nA: This means that there is already a mycobot_ros package in ~/catkin_ws/src. You need to delete it in advance and then re-execute the git operation.\n\nQ: When rosrun is running, the terminal reports an error counld not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: Permission: '/dev/ttyUSB0'. Why? \n\nA: The serial port permissions are insufficient. Enter sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0 in the terminal to grant permissions.\n\nQ: Why can't the ros program run in vscode? \n\nA: Because the vscode terminal cannot be loaded into the ros environment, it needs to be run in the system terminal.\n\nQ: When rosrun is running, the terminal prompts Unable to register with master node [http://localhost:11311]: master may not be running yet. Will keep trying. Why? \n\nA: Before running the ros program, you need to open the ros node and enter roscore in the terminal.\n\nQ: When rosrun is running, the terminal reports an error message counld not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyUSB1'. Why? \n\nA: The serial port is incorrect. You need to confirm the actual serial port of the current robot. You can check it through ls /dev/tty*.\n\nQ: In Ubuntu18.04, catkin_make failed to build the code, and the terminal prompted Project 'cv_bridge' specifies '/usr/include/opencv' as an include dir, which is not found. and other error messages\n\nA: The opencv path in the configuration file does not match the actual system path. You need to use sudo to modify the configuration file (path is /opt/ros/melodic/share/cv_bridge/cmake/cv_bridgeConfig.cmake), and the actual opencv path of the system is under the /usr/include/ path.\n\nQ: After cloning the mycobot_ros package, and then directly running the rosrun program, an error like package 'mycobot_280' not found or an error such as the file cannot be found appears? \n\nA: The mycobot_ros that has just been cloned needs to build the code for ros environment compilation. Terminal input\n\ncd ~/catkin_ws/\ncatkin_make\nsource devel/setup.bash\n\nQ: After the compilation is completed, why does the following error appear when running the launch command in a new terminal? \n\n\nA1: The system does not add ros environment variables, so you need to source it every time you open a new terminal:\n\ncd ~/catkin_ws/\nsource devel/setup.bash\n\n\nA2: The system adds ros environment variables, so you don’t need to execute source every time you open a new terminal:\n\n# noetic is Ubuntu20.04 system\necho \"source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA3: The file name in the command may be inconsistent with the actual file name in the mycobot_ros package. Please check the command carefully for errors.\n\n"},"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.3-hardware.html":{"url":"4-SupportAndService/9.Troubleshooting/9.3-hardware.html","title":"4.4 Common hardware problems and solutions","keywords":"","body":"Hardware Problem1 About Structure2 About parameters3 About the end gripperHardware Problem\n1 About Structure\nQ: How to solve the problem of arm shaking? \n\nA: Enter mystudio and burn the latest version of atommain firmware to the ATOM of the robot arm.\nThen update the pymycobot version (Win+R and enter cmd to open the terminal), and use pip to update pymycobot.\n(Here enter pip install pymycobot --upgrade --user and press Enter to run).\nFinally, find the pid_read_write.py file in github, download and save it to your computer or Raspberry Pi system.\nFollow the prompts in the code to modify each parameter configuration of the corresponding servo number. The parameter serial number corresponds to the serial number shown in the picture one by one, and you can run it after modification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that all joint parameters of each robot arm are not uniform, and they need to be compared and modified according to the robot arm model corresponding to the figure below.\npid_read_write.py file corresponding github link: https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot/tree/main/demo\nQ: What are the limits of myCobot's joints? \n\nA: One axis and five axes have limits, one axis is about 160° clockwise and about 160° counterclockwise. The five axes can rotate clockwise and counterclockwise about 160°\n\nNote: When rotating the robot arm, it should be rotated at a small angle and gently. After reaching the limit, it cannot be rotated forcefully. \nQ: What controls the six servos? \n\nA: The servos are controlled by the atom on the top.\n\nQ: What is the role of the atom in the robot arm? \n\nA: The atom in the robot arm mainly controls the kinematic algorithm of the robot arm: including forward and inverse kinematics, solution selection, acceleration and deceleration, speed synchronization, multi-square interpolation, coordinate conversion, etc., and requires real-time control and multi-threading. The related programs of atom are not open source yet.\n\nQ: Why is there no display on the display when the microprocessor-based robot arm is connected to the HDMI interface? Do you need to download the serial port driver? \n\nA: Check whether the wiring is correct and whether the power switch is turned on. Try to replace the HDMI interface. There are two HDMI interfaces on the robot arm. The interface part should be firmly inserted. No need to download the serial port driver.\nThere is another situation that you may have powered on the robot arm first and then connected the HDMI cable. This will also cause the monitor to have no input signal.

It provides the services that an operating system should have, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of common functions, messaging between processes, and package management. It also provides the tools and library functions needed to obtain, compile, write, and run code across computers.\nThe \"graph\" of the ROS runtime is a loosely coupled point-to-point process network based on the ROS communication infrastructure. ROS implements several different communication methods, including services based on synchronous RPC-style communication, topics based on asynchronous streaming data, and parameter servers for data storage.\nROS is not a real-time framework, but ROS can be embedded in real-time programs. Willow Garage's PR2 robot uses a system called pr2_etherCAT to send or receive ROS messages in real time. ROS can also be seamlessly integrated with the Orocos real-time toolkit.\nDesign goals and features of ROS\nMany people ask \"What is the difference between ROS and other robotics software platforms?\" This is a difficult question to answer. Because ROS is not a framework that integrates most functions or features. In fact, the main goal of ROS is to support code reuse for robotics research and development. ROS is a framework of distributed processes (i.e. nodes) that are packaged in packages and function packages that are easy to share and distribute.\nROS also supports a federated system similar to a code repository, which also enables collaboration and distribution of projects. This design allows the development and implementation of a project to be completely independent of decisions (not limited by ROS) from the file system to the user interface. At the same time, all projects can be integrated with the basic tools of ROS.\nIn order to support the main goal of sharing and collaboration, the ROS framework has several other characteristics:\n\nLean: ROS is designed to be as lean as possible so that code written for ROS can be used with other robotics software frameworks. A corollary to this is that ROS can be easily integrated with other robotics software platforms: ROS has been integrated with OpenRAVE, Orocos and Player.\n\nROS-insensitive libraries: The preferred development model of ROS is written in clean library functions that do not depend on ROS.\n\nLanguage independence: The ROS framework can be easily implemented in any modern programming language. ROS has implemented Python version, C++ version and Lisp version. It also has Java and Lua version experimental libraries.\n\nLoose coupling: The function modules in ROS are encapsulated in independent function packages or meta-function packages for easy sharing. The modules in the function package run as nodes and use ROS standard IO as the interface. Developers do not need to pay attention to the internal implementation of the module. As long as they understand the interface rules, they can reuse it, realizing point-to-point loose coupling connection between modules\nConvenient testing: ROS has a built-in unit/integration test framework called rostest, which can easily install or uninstall test modules.\nScalable: ROS can be applied to large runtime systems and large development processes.\nFree and open source: many developers and many function packages\n\nWhy use ROS\nThrough ROS, we can realize the simulation control of the robot arm in a virtual environment.\nWe will use the rviz platform to realize the visualization of the robot arm and use a variety of methods to operate our robot arm; through the moveit platform to plan and execute the robot arm's action path, we can achieve the effect of free control of the robot arm.\nIn the next chapter, we will learn how to control our products through the platform in ros.\nROS1 Tutorial Guide\nEnvironment Building\nROS1 Basics\nrviz Introduction and Use\nmoveit Introduction and Use\n"},"3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.2-EnvironmentBuilding.html":{"url":"3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/12.1-ROS1/12.1.2-EnvironmentBuilding.html","title":"6.2.1 ROS1 Environment Building","keywords":"","body":"ROS environment setupRaspberry Pi version:Update mycobot_ros packageROS environment setup\nRaspberry Pi version:\nThe Raspberry Pi version comes with Ubuntu (V-20.04) system and built-in development environment.

This is the axis of rotation (revolute joint), the axis along which the prismatic joint moves, and the standard plane of the planar joint. This axis is specified in the joint coordinate system. Modifying this parameter can adjust the axis around which the joint rotates. It is often used to adjust the direction of rotation.

On the one hand, it can realize the graphical display of external information. On the other hand, it can also release control information to objects through rviz, thereby realizing the monitoring and control of robots.\nIntroduction to the installation and interface of rviz\nWhen installing ros, if you perform a complete installation, rviz has been installed, and you can try to run it directly; if it is not fully installed, you can install rviz separately:\n# Ubuntu16.04\nsudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rviz\n\n# Ubuntu18.04\nsudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rviz\n\n# Ubuntu20.04\nsudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rviz\n\nAfter the installation is complete, please open a new terminal (shortcut key Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the following command:\nroscore\n\nThen open a new terminal (shortcut key Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the command to open rviz\nrosrun rviz rviz\n# or\nrviz\n\nOpen rviz and the following interface will be displayed:\n\nIntroduction to each area\n\nOn the left is the display list. A display is something that draws something in the 3D world and may have some options available in the display list.\n\nOn the top is the toolbar, which allows users to select multiple functions with various function keys\n\nIn the middle is the 3D view: it is the main screen that allows users to view various data in three dimensions. The background color, fixed frame, grid, etc. of the 3D view can be set in detail in the Global Options and Grid items displayed on the left.\n\nBelow is the time display area, including system time and ROS time.\n\nOn the right is the observation angle setting area, which can set different observation angles.\n\n\nIn this section, we will only give a rough introduction.

It is like a combiner: it integrates all individual components together and provides a series of actions and services for users to use.\n\nUser Interface\nUsers can access the operations and services provided by move_group in three ways:\n\nIn C++: Use the move_group_interface package to facilitate the practical use of move_group.\nIn Python: Use the moveit_commander package.\n\nVia GUI: Use Rviz (ROS Visualizer) from Motion-commander.\n\n\nmove_group can be configured using the ROS parameter server, from which it can also get the robot's URDF and SRDF.\nConfiguration\nmove_group is a ROS node. It uses the ROS parameter server to get three kinds of information:\n\nURDF - move_group looks up the robot_description parameter on the ROS parameter server to get the robot's URDF.\n\nSRDF - move_group looks up the robot_description_semantic parameter on the ROS parameter server to get the robot's SRDF. The SRDF is usually created by the user using the MoveIt Setup Assistant.\n\nMoveIt Configuration - move_group will look up additional configuration specific to MoveIt on the ROS parameter server, including joint limits, kinematics, motion planning, perception, and other information.

However, ROS itself is not an operating system, but a software library and tool set.\nThe emergence of ROS solved the communication problem of various robot components. Later, more and more robot algorithms were integrated into ROS. ROS2 inherited ROS and is more powerful and easier to use than ROS.\nDesign goals and features of ROS2\nROS2 shoulders the historical mission of changing the era of intelligent robots. At the beginning of the design, it was considered to meet the needs of various robot applications.\n\nMulti-robot system: In the future, robots are no longer independent individuals, and robots also need to communicate and collaborate. ROS2 provides standard methods and communication mechanisms for the application of multi-robot systems.\n\nCross-platform: The control platforms used will be very different in different robot application scenarios. In order to enable all robots to run ROS2, ROS2 can run cross-platform on Linux, Windows, MacOS, and RTOS.\n\nReal-time: Robot motion control and many behavioral strategies require robots to be real-time. For example, a robot must reliably detect pedestrians in front of it within 100 milliseconds, or complete kinematic and dynamic calculations within 1 millisecond. ROS2 provides basic requirements in real time like this.\n\nProductization: A large number of robots have entered our lives, and there will be more and more in the future. ROS2 can not only be used in the robot R&D stage, but can also be directly installed in products and enter the consumer market. This also poses a huge challenge to the stability and robustness of ROS2.\n\nProject management: Robot development is a complex system engineering. Project management tools and mechanisms for the entire process of design, development, debugging, testing, and deployment will also be reflected in ROS2, making it easier for us to develop robots.\n\n\nRelease version\nThe corresponding release version and maintenance cycle of ROS2 and Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nROS2 version\nRelease date\nMaintenance period\nUbuntu version\n\n\n\n\nDashing\n2019.5\n2021.5\nUbuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)\n\n\nEloquent\n2019.11\n2020.11\nUbuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)\n\n\nFoxy\n2020.6\n2023.5\nUbuntu 20.04(Focal Fossa)\n\n\nGalactic\n2021.5\n2022.11\nUbuntu 20.04(Focal Fossa)\n\n\nHumble\n2022.5\n2027.5\nUbuntu 22.04(Jammy Jellyfish)\n\n\n\nComparison between ROS and ROS2\nROS2 redesigned the system architecture. The architectural changes between the two generations of ROS are as follows:\n\n\nOS Layer: OS layer. In ROS2, it can be built on Linux or other systems, even bare metal without an operating system.\n\nMiddleware Layer: Middleware layer. The communication system of ROS1 is based on TCPROS/UDPROS, while the communication system of ROS2 is based on DDS. DDS is a standard solution for data publishing/subscription in distributed real-time systems.\n\nApplication Layer: Application layer. ROS1 relies on ROS Master, while in ROS2, a discovery mechanism called \"Discovery\" is used between nodes to help each other establish connections.\n\n\nROS has designed a complete set of communication mechanisms (topics, services, parameters, actions) to simplify robot development. Through this mechanism, the various components of the robot can be connected. This mechanism designs a node called Ros Master, and the communication of all other components must go through the master node. Once the master node hangs up, it will cause the communication of the entire robot system to collapse! Therefore, the instability of Ros cannot be used to make some high-risk robots such as autonomous driving. In addition, there are the following disadvantages:\n\nTCP-based communication has poor real-time performance and high system overhead\nNot friendly to python3 support\nIncompatible message mechanism\nNo encryption mechanism, low security\n\nROS2 first removes the master node in ROS. After removing the master node, each node can discover each other through the DDS node. Each node is equal and can achieve one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many communication. After using DDS for communication, reliability and stability are enhanced.\nCompared with ROS that only supports Linux systems, ROS2 also supports Windows, Mac and even RTOS platforms.\nROS2 Development Guide\nROS2 Installation Guide\nROS2 Basic Use\nrivz Use Guide\n"},"3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/12.2-ROS2/12.2.1-InstallationOfROS2.html":{"url":"3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/ROS/12.2-ROS2/12.2.1-InstallationOfROS2.html","title":"6.3.1 ROS2 environment construction","keywords":"","body":"ROS2 environment installationRaspberry Pi version:Update mycobot_ros2 packageROS2 environment installation\nRaspberry Pi version:\nThe Raspberry Pi version comes with Ubuntu (V-20.04) system and built-in development environment.

Each node can send and receive data to other nodes through topics, services, actions, or parameters.\nA complete robotic system consists of many nodes working together. In ROS 2, a single executable file (C++ program, Python program, etc.) can contain one or more nodes.\nSpecific reference: Official tutorial\n\nnodes help\n\nros2 nodes -h\n\n\nStart turtlesim and keyboard control\n\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\n\n\nView the node list\n\nros2 node list\n\n\nView the node relationship graph\n\nrqt_graph\n\n\nRemap\n\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args --remap __node:=my_turtle\nros2 node list\n\n\nView node information\n\nros2 node info \nros2 node info /my_turtle\n\nServices\nServices are another way for nodes in the ROS graph to communicate.

They consist of three parts: a goal, a response, and a result.\nActions are based on topics and services. They function like services, except that actions are preemptible (you can cancel them while they are executing). They also provide steady feedback, rather than services that return a single response.\nActions use a client-server model, similar to the publisher-subscriber model (described in the topic tutorial). An \"action client\" node sends a target to an \"action server\" node, which confirms the target and returns a stream of feedback and results.\nSpecific reference: Official tutorial\n\naction help\n\nros2 action -h\n\n\nStart turtlesim and keyboard control\n\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\nros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\n\nPress G|B|V|C|D|E|R|T to rotate, press F to cancel\n\nView the server and client of the node action\n\nros2 node info /turtlesim\n\n\nView the action list\n\nros2 action list\nros2 action list -t # DisplayAction type\n\n\nView action information\n\nros2 action info \nros2 action info /turtle1/rotate_absolute\n\n\nView action message content\n\nros2 interface show turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute\n\n\nSend action target information\n\nros2 action send_goal  \nros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute \"{theta: 1.57}\"\n# With feedback information\nros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute \"{theta: 0}\" --feedback\n\nRQt\nRQt is a graphical user interface framework that implements various tools and interfaces in the form of plugins.

It is also responsible for monitoring the status of launched processes and reporting and/or responding to changes in the status of those processes.\nLaunch files written in Python, XML, or YAML can start and stop different nodes, as well as trigger and handle various events.\nSpecific reference: Official Tutorial\nSetup\nCreate a new directory to store your launch file:\n` ``bash\nmkdir launch\nfrom launch import LaunchDescription\nfrom launch_ros.actions import Node\n\ndef generate_launch_description():\n    return LaunchDescription([\n        Node(\n            package='turtlesim',\n            namespace='turtlesim1',\n            executable='turtlesim_node',\n            name='sim'\n        ),\n        Node(\n            package='turtlesim',\n            namespace='turtlesim2',\n            executable='turtlesim_node',\n            name='sim'\n        ),\n        Node(\n            package='turtlesim',\n            executable='mimic',\n            name='mimic',\n            remappings=[\n                ('/input/pose', '/turtlesim1/turtle1/pose'),\n                ('/output/cmd_vel', '/turtlesim2/turtle1/cmd_vel'),\n            ]\n        )\n    ])\nRun the ros2 launch file\nTo run the launch file created above, go to the directory you created earlier and run the following command:\nThe syntax format is:\nros2 launch  \ncd launch\nros2 launch turtlesim_mimic_launch.py\n\nlaunch help\n\nros2 launch -h\n\n\nRun Node\n\nros2 launch turtlesim multisim.launch.py\n\n\nCheck the parameters of the launch file\n\nros2 launch turtlebot3_fake_node turtlebot3_fake_node.launch.py ​​-s\nros2 launch turtlebot3_fake_node turtlebot3_fake_node.launch. py --show-arguments\nros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.launch.py ​​-s\n\n\nRun launch file with parameters\n\nros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.launch.py ​​usb_port:=/dev/ opencr\n\n\nRun the node and debug\n\nros2 launch turtlesim turtlesim_node.launch.py ​​-d\n\n\nOnly output node description\n\nros2 launch turtlesim turtlesim_node.launch. py -p\n\n\nRun component\n\nros2 launch composition composition_demo.launch.py\n\nRun\nrun is used to run a single node, component program.\n\nrun help\n\nros2 run -h\n\n\nrun node\n\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\n\n\nrun node with parameters\n\nros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args -r __node:=turtle2 -r __ns:=/ns2\n\n\nRun component container\n\nros2 run rclcpp_components component_container\n\n\nRun component ```bash\nros2 run composition manual_composition\nPackage\nA package can be thought of as a container for your ROS 2 code. If you want to be able to install your code or share it with others, you need to organize it in a Packages allow you to publish your ROS 2 work and allow others to easily build and use it.\nPackage creation in ROS 2 uses ament as its build system and colcon as its build tool. You can create packages using the officially supported CMake or Python, but other build types do exist.\nSpecific parameters: Official tutorial\nCreating a Workspace\nCreate a new directory for each new workspace. The name is not important, but it helps indicate the purpose of the workspace.

To install the pymycobot library, open the terminal (Win key + R key), enter: pip install pymycobot --upgrade --user, and press Enter to display Successfully installed pymycobot.\n\nQ2: The robot arm is unresponsive due to the lack of a sleep method module\nA: The program that operates the robot arm movement takes time to complete, so a sleep module needs to be connected after an action to give the robot arm time to move before the next movement (the required time depends on the situation, and the robot arm is set by default to run myBlockly with a minimum sleep time of no less than 0.5s), otherwise the robot arm will not be able to achieve the desired movement.\nQ3: The Run button in the upper right corner cannot be clicked, and it is gray-green. \nA: The new version of myBlockly has added the function of detecting the serial communication of the robot arm. If the robot arm is currently connected to the computer, you need to check:\n(1) Is there a background program occupying the robot arm's serial port?\n(2) Is the toolbar under the red arrow on the right closed? If it is open, you need to manually close it.\nQ4: Why do I get a lot of errors after running the program? \nA: Before running the program, you need to confirm a few points:\n(1) Please make sure that your robot arm's serial port number and baud rate are correct.\n How to check the serial port number:\n\nIn Windows, find the device manager and check the port.\n\nIf the port (COM and LPT) shows USB-Enhanced-SERIAL CH9102, it is a CP34X chip.\nIf the port (COM and LPT) shows Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge, it is a CP210X chip. The ports with these two names are the serial port numbers of your robot arm.\n\nIn Linux, open the terminal and enter ls/dev/tty* and press Enter. The serial port number of the robot arm is displayed. AMA0 or USB0\nis the serial port number of your robot arm.\nOpen the terminal on Mac, enter cd /dev/ and press Enter, then ls -al tty to find it, for example /dev/tty.usbserial-10.\n\n(2) Please make sure the baud rate is correct. The baud rates of M5, myCobot 320 Pi-2020, myCobot 320 Pi-2022, myCobot 280 Jetson nano, and myCobot 280 Arudino are all 115200. The baud rates of myCobot 280 Pi, myPalletizer 260 Pi, mecahrm 270 Pi, myBuddy 280, Pro 600, etc. are all 1000000.\n(3) Please make sure that the model, serial port number, and baud rate in the blue box are consistent with those in the small toolbar on the right, and match the robot arm.\nQ5: Error MyCobot.int() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given.\nA: This error will appear in the old version of myBlockly because the versions of myBlockly and pymycobot do not match. Just update the versions of myBlockly and pymycobot driver library.\nQ6: The result of running the program shows child process exited with code 1\nA: This is not an error. All programs have finished running and returned the binary number 1. It means that everything has been successfully completed.\n"},"3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/CommunicationProtocolPackage/18-communication.html":{"url":"3-FunctionsAndApplications/6.developmentGuide/CommunicationProtocolPackage/18-communication.html","title":"6.5 Development and use based on serial communication protocol","keywords":"","body":"Communication and message commandsRobotic arm motion parametersUSB Communication SettingsCommand frame description and single command analysisCommand frame sending and receiving formatCommand parsingSingle command analysisSerial port return example: FE FE 03 12 01 FANo return valueNo return valueNo return valueNo return valueNo return valueCommunication and message commands\nNote: To use the communication protocol for direct communication, you need to burn transponder in basic and the latest version of atomMain in atom\n\nRobotic arm motion parameters\n\n\n\nJoint\n*Joint minimum value °\nJoint maximum value °\nJoint maximum speed °/s\nJoint maximum acceleration °/s²\n\n\n\n\nJ1\n-168\n168\n150\n200\n\n\nJ2\n-135\n135\n150\n200\n\n\nJ3\n-150\n150\n150\n200\n\n\nJ4\n-145\n145\n150\n200\n\n\nJ5\n-165\n165\n150\n200\n\n\nJ6\n-180\n180\n150\n200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis\n*Minimum value of coordinate mm\nMaximum value of coordinate mm\nMaximum velocity of coordinate mm/s\nMaximum acceleration of coordinate mm/s²\n\n\n\n\nx\n-281.45\n281.45\n100\n400\n\n\ny\n-281.45\n281.45\n100\n400\n\n\nz\n-70\n412.76\n100\n400\n\n\nrx\n-180°\n180°\n40°\n66°/s²\n\n\nry\n-180°\n180°\n40°\n66°/s²\n\n\nrz\n-180°\n180°\n40°\n66°/s²\n\n\n\nUSB Communication Settings\n\nPlease make sure your communication settings are as follows\n\nBus interface: USB Type-C connection\n\nBaud rate: 115200\n\nData bits: 8\nParity: None\nStop bits: 1\n\nCommand frame description and single command analysis\nThe host Basic sends data to the slave, and the slave parses the data after receiving it.

The specific implementation methods are as follows:\n\nChange the end coordinate system\n\nThe end coordinate system can be set through the setEndType and getEndType functions. EndType::FLANGE sets the end to the flange, and EndType::TOOL sets the end to the tool end.\n\nThe coordinate information of the tool can be set through the setToolReference and getToolReference functions. When setting, the flange coordinate system is used as the relative coordinate system, and the tool end information is relative to the flange coordinate system.\n\nAfter setting EndType to FLANGE, the GetCoords and WriteCoords methods are calculated based on the flange position.\n\nAfter setting EndType to TOOL, the GetCoords and WriteCoords methods are calculated based on the tool end position.\n\nChange the base coordinate system\n\nThe base coordinate system can be set through the setReferenceFrame function. RFType::BASE uses the robot base as the base coordinate, and RFType::WORLD uses the world coordinate system as the base coordinate. The getReferenceFrame function is used to read the current base coordinate system type.\n\nThe setWorldReference and getWorldReference functions can be used to set and read the base coordinate system information. When setting, the world coordinate system is used as the relative coordinate system, and the position information of the robot's base relative to the world coordinate system is input.\nWhen the base coordinate system is the base, the GetCoords and WriteCoords methods both use the base as the reference coordinate system.\nWhen the base coordinate system is the world coordinate system, the GetCoords and WriteCoords methods both use the world coordinate system as the reference coordinate system.\n\nCommunication related changes (temporary)\nNow add the setting and reading of the end coordinate system, the setting and reading of the world coordinate system, the setting and reading of the current reference coordinate system, the setting and reading of the end type, the setting and reading of the movement method, and the sending and receiving of the robot information.\nThese communications are temporarily set to 0x80 to 0x8A\nIn the ParameterList.h file, add a new roboticMessages space for adding robot communication information. Now only temporarily add the prompt of \"no inverse solution\", which can be added later.\nThe simple design idea of ​​MOVEL function is as follows:\nCalculate the Euclidean distance between the initial point and the target point, and insert an interpolation point every 10mm based on the Euclidean distance. If there is no inverse solution for the interpolation point, search for an inverse solution in the adjacent space of positive and negative PI/30 in the three directions of the unchanged position, mainly to avoid singular values ​​and some special positions where the solution cannot be found.\nThe point sending interval of MOVEL and JOG is changed to dynamic time. The moving time is calculated according to the maximum joint moving distance between the two points, and then the moving time minus the specific time is used as the time interval.\n"},"3-FunctionsAndApplications/7.SuccessfulCase/7-SuccessfulCases.html":{"url":"3-FunctionsAndApplications/7.SuccessfulCase/7-SuccessfulCases.html","title":"7.
