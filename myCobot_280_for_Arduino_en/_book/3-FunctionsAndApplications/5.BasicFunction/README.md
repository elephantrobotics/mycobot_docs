# Chapter 5 Basic Functions

**This chapter mainly explains the basic functions and usage of the product and the use of basic software. This chapter is very important and should be read carefully in order. Before actually applying the robot, please make sure you understand the described operations correctly. **

**The myCobot 280 for Arduino version is developed and used based on PC and development board. There is no built-in system inside the robot arm, so the robot arm, PC and development board need to be combined during use. So please prepare a PC and development board before use**

myCobot 280 For Arduino uses ATOM Matrix ESP32 Development Kit core development board as the main control. It is equipped with the robot motion control operating system firmware independently developed by Elephant Robot, with built-in kinematic forward and inverse solutions. It supports the combination of various Arduino development boards for extended application development. Using the Arduino development board with a variety of sensors officially supported by Arduino, you can quickly build a robot arm. The preferred assistant for machine vision and robot applications, control logic development, robot fusion development, and ROS simulation experiment classrooms, helping you quickly start learning and applying six-axis robot arms.

Please follow the following chapters to learn the basic functions of the myCobot 280 For Arduino version of the robot arm.

[System Usage Introduction](5.1-Functionlnstruction/DevelopmEntenvironment.md)
This section will briefly introduce the development environment of the 280 For Arduino robot arm. Because the myCobot 280 for Arduino version does not have a built-in development environment, you need to use a PC to install the development environment for the robot arm.<br>
[MyStudio Introduction](5.2-Softwarelnstructions/README.md)
The one-stop service platform myStudio integrates myCobot software resources and various materials, and supports firmware downloads and updates. Provides product usage video tutorials and maintenance/repair information.<br>
[Hardware Interface Description](5.3-FirmwareFunctionDescription/RoboticArmElectricalInterface.md)
This section will introduce the common hardware interface of the 280 For Arduino version robot
