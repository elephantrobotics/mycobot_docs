# Software Issues

**Q: Why can't my compiler find the corresponding device? **
- A: You need to build a development environment and install the corresponding project library before you can develop the device.

## 1 About myStudio

**Q: What is myStudio? **
- A: It is our company's self-developed software. It is a tool for burning or modifying the firmware of the existing robotic arms launched by our company.

**Q: Is there any difference between the firmware used by MyCobot 320 M5-2020 and 2022? **
- A: The requirements for using the old version 320 firmware are as follows
M5 version: minirobot1.0+atommain4.2;
PI version: ubuntu18.04+atommain4.1;
The requirements for using the new version 320 firmware are as follows
M5 version: minirobot2.1+picomain1.0+atommain5.0;
PI version: ubuntu18.04+picomain1.0+atommain5.0;
**This firmware combination is up to mystudio version v4.3.1**

**Q: Why can't the device work properly after I burn the firmware to the ATOM terminal? **
- A: The firmware of the ATOM terminal needs to use our factory firmware. Other unofficial firmware cannot be changed during use. If the device accidentally burns other firmware, you can use "myCobot firmware burner" to select ATOM terminal-select serial port-select ATOMMAIN firmware to burn the ATOM terminal.

**Q: Can the drag teaching in the firmware record the gripper action? **
- A: It is not possible to use drag teaching to record the gripper movements for the time being, because the gripper belongs to joint number 7, and our drag teaching can only record and play the movements of joints numbered 1-6.

**Q: Why can't drag teaching be performed after burning the minirobot firmware? **
- A: First check whether both the M5Stack-basic firmware and the atom firmware have been burned, whether the burned firmware corresponds to the requirements to be implemented, and whether the burned firmware is the latest version.
- It is recommended to burn the minirobot firmware to version v2.1 and the top atommain firmware to version v4.1 and above (need to support mystudio version v4.3.1 and above).

**Q: What should I do if mycobot's serial port cannot be recognized on mystudio? **
- A: If your computer device does not prompt for the connected robot arm, please install the serial port driver first.
- It should also be noted that the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Jetson nano series robot arms are **cannot be connected to a laptop using a data cable**, and need to use mystudio in the built-in system for firmware burning.

**Q: Can I save the recorded trajectory of drag teaching to the card? **

- A: Currently, it cannot be saved to the memory card. And drag teaching can only save one path at a time, and the next recording will overwrite the previous action.

## 2 About RoboFlow

**Q: Can robotStudio software programming be used? **
- A: Our own industrial programming software roboFlow can be used. RobotStudio is from ABB and cannot communicate with us.

**Q: What is the reason for the rapid movement of roboFlow software beyond the limit? **

- A: It may be that one or more joints exceed the limit.

**Q: How does roboflow load the already written program? **

- A: After logging in, select program robot, and then click load program. Clicking run program directly does not work, only pro600 can.

**Q: When pro600 uses roboflow, the log shows that 456 joints have stopped. Is this normal? **

- A: This is a normal phenomenon.


## 3 About myCobot phone controller

**Q: What version of firmware should be burned in myCobot phone controller app? **
- A: You need to burn atom firmware atommain2.5 version in mystudio.
- **(As of now, the mobile APP control function has been disabled. Please pay attention to the firmware version information of mystudio for the restart time.)**

## 4 About myblockly

**Q: When myblockly is running, child process exited with code 0 always appears. Why? **

- A: This is not an error. The real error needs to be analyzed according to the specific situation. This string of characters represents the end of the program running, and the binary number 0 is returned, which means termination.

## 5 About Arduino

**Q: Arduino program running error: multiple libraries are corresponding and MycobotSaver.h file cannot be found**

- A: First of all, the first error is that multiple libraries are corresponding, prompting used and unused libraries. Just delete one library.
There is another error that MycobotSaver.h is not found. This is a problem with the library name. You need to change it to MyCobotSaver.h.
This program may have been used before, and the file name has been changed later. You can find the MyCobotSaver file, and then copy and paste the found MyCobotSaver file into the myCobotProBasic folder.

**Q: 280Arduino control method**

- A: 1. Yes, if you use the uno board, you do need arduino to control it. For the mkrwifi1010 mega2560 board, you can use python or ros.

2. The uno board is connected to the arduino board via a Dupont line, and cannot be directly plugged in.
3. Our arduino has a case that you can use directly. I will give you a link and screenshot, and you can burn it directly into the uno board. If you want to develop other arduino programs yourself, you can directly compile the last case with the Arduino software. The tutorial is in this part.

## 6 About ROS1

**Q: When the terminal switches to ~/catkin_ws/src and uses git to install and update mycobot_ros, the target path "mycobot_ros" already exists. What is the reason? **
- A: This means that there is already a `mycobot_ros` package in `~/catkin_ws/src`. You need to delete it in advance and then re-execute the git operation.

**Q: When rosrun is running, the terminal reports an error `counld not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: Permission: '/dev/ttyUSB0'`. Why? **

- A: The serial port permissions are insufficient. Enter `sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0` in the terminal to grant permissions.

**Q: Why can't the ros program run in vscode? **

- A: Because the vscode terminal cannot be loaded into the ros environment, it needs to be run in the system terminal.

**Q: When rosrun is running, the terminal prompts `Unable to register with master node [http://localhost:11311]: master may not be running yet. Will keep trying`. Why? **

- A: Before running the ros program, you need to open the ros node and enter `roscore` in the terminal.

**Q: When rosrun is running, the terminal reports an error message `counld not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyUSB1'`. Why? **

- A: The serial port is incorrect. You need to confirm the actual serial port of the current robot. You can check it through `ls /dev/tty*`.

**Q: In Ubuntu18.04, `catkin_make` failed to build the code, and the terminal prompted `Project 'cv_bridge' specifies '/usr/include/opencv' as an include dir, which is not found.` and other error messages**

- A: The opencv path in the configuration file does not match the actual system path. You need to use sudo to modify the configuration file (path is `/opt/ros/melodic/share/cv_bridge/cmake/cv_bridgeConfig.cmake`), and the actual opencv path of the system is under the `/usr/include/` path.

**Q: After cloning the mycobot_ros package, and then directly running the rosrun program, an error like `package 'mycobot_280' not found` or an error such as the file cannot be found appears? **

- A: The mycobot_ros that has just been cloned needs to build the code for ros environment compilation. Terminal input

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

**Q: After the compilation is completed, why does the following error appear when running the launch command in a new terminal? **

![Software](9.images/sw.png)

- A1: The system does not add ros environment variables, so you need to source it every time you open a new terminal:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
```

- A2: The system adds ros environment variables, so you donâ€™t need to execute source every time you open a new terminal:

```bash
# noetic is Ubuntu20.04 system
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- A3: The file name in the command may be inconsistent with the actual file name in the mycobot_ros package. Please check the command carefully for errors.
