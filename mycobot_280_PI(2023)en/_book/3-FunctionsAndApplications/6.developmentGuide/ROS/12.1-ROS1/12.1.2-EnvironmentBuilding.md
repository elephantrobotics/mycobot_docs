## 1 ROS environment setup
## Raspberry Pi version:

**The Raspberry Pi version comes with Ubuntu (V-20.04) system and built-in development environment. No setup and management is required. Just update the `mycobot_ros` package. **

`mycobot_ros` is a ROS1 package for the mycobot series of desktop six-axis robotic arms launched by Elephant Robotics.

ROS1 project address: [http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros](http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros)

Robot arm API driver library address: [https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot)

## 1 Update mycobot_ros package

To ensure that users can use the latest official package in a timely manner, you can go to the `/home/er/catkin_ws/src` folder through the file manager, open the console terminal (shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), and enter the following command to update:

```bash
# Clone the code on github
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros.git # Before deciding whether to execute this command, please check the following note
cd .. # Return to the workspace
catkin_make # Build the code in the workspace
source devel/setup.bash # Add environment variables
```

**Note:** If the `mycobot_ros` folder already exists in the `/home/er/catkin_ws/src (equivalent to ~/catkin_ws/src)` directory, you need to delete the original `mycobot_ros` first, and then execute the above command. Among them, `er` in the directory path is the system user name. If there is any inconsistency, please modify it.

At this point, the ROS1 environment is set up.
