# Chapter 5 Basic Functions

**This chapter mainly explains the basic functions and usage of the product and the use of basic software. This chapter is very important and should be read carefully in order. Before actually applying the robot, please make sure you understand the described operations correctly. **

#### About the difference between M5 version and PI version machine

The M5 version machine is a joint product of Elephant Robot and Shenzhen Mingzhan Technology Co., Ltd. - M5STACK. It uses the Esp32 core processor and has two display screens and multiple physical buttons. The PI version machine is an official joint product of Elephant Robot and Raspberry Pi. The robotic arm uses the Raspberry Pi RaspBerry PI 4B core processor. It is designed to meet the needs of customers for Linux system applications and the needs of all-in-one integrated robot development and convenient equipment.

**PI model robot is a computer host**

The PI version machine is embedded with Raspberry Pi 4B, 1.5GHz 4-core microprocessor, runs Debian/Ubuntu platform, supports 4 USB, 2 HDMI, standardized GPIO interface TF card pluggable.

The essence of the PI version machine is a development board with an independent system. It can be regarded as a miniature computer host. The host and the host cannot simply communicate through a line. It can only be connected to an independent monitor, and equipped with a power supply, mouse and keyboard, and then developed and operated after entering the built-in system of the development board.

**❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗ Tips⚠: Please use the HDMI cable delivered with the package to connect the monitor and use the built-in system for development❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗**
